      <h1 class="home__title">Tinting makes it possible to correct colours in brickwork, stone and concrete</h1>

      <div class="home__paragraph">

        <p>By creating bespoke tints and applying them with a keen eye for detail, we are able to <span class="home__paragraph--bold">disguise ugly repairs</span class="home__paragraph--bold">, re-unite extensions with the original building or perhaps even create a whole new appearance throughout. As well as providing a very <span class="home__paragraph--bold">natural result</span>, the process is <span class="home__paragraph--bold">permanent</span> and comes with a 25 year guarantee.</p>
        <p> We always begin with a considered assessment of the situation as unsightly masonry may be affected by more than simply colour differences. With considerable experience in building repair and conservation, we are able to refer you to other services (such as repointing or repairs) if tinting is not the solution or only part of it. </p>
        <p> Once you have seen some examples of our work, please <span class="home__paragraph--bold">feel free to get in touch</span> and send us some photos - weâ€™ll come back to you with an honest appraisal of the possible options.</p>
