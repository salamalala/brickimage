      <div class="home__paragraph">
        <p>By creating bespoke tints and applying them with a keen eye, we are able to disguise ugly repairs, unite extensions with the original building or perhaps create a whole new appearance throughout. This process provides a very natural, permanent colour change and comes with a 25 year guarantee.</p>
        <p>With considerable background in building repair and conservation, we always begin with a considered assessment of the situation as unsightly masonry may be affected by more than simply colour differences. Once you have seen <a href="/examples.html">some examples</a>  of our work, please <a href="/contact.html">get in touch</a> and send us some photos.</p>
