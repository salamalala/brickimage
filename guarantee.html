    <h1>Properties of the dyes we use</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3 class="guarantee__list-heading">Non-toxic:</h3>
        <span class="guarantee__list-text"> The dyes are composed of microscopic inorganic iron oxide pigments (conforming to British Standard 1014). They contain no harmful products and no v.o.c.’s (Volatile Organic Compounds).</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="guarantee__list-heading">Ultra fine:</h3>
        <span class="guarantee__list-text"> The small size of the pigments enables them to effectively penetrate and ‘stain’, rather than ‘coat’, the surface of the masonry.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="guarantee__list-heading">Permanent:</h3>
        <span class="guarantee__list-text"> The dyes react chemically with the masonry substrate to produce an insoluble, microcrystalline silicate bond. Unlike masonry paints, once applied there are no subsequent maintenance commitments.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="guarantee__list-heading">Non-corrosive:</h3>
        <span class="guarantee__list-text"> The original surface texture of the masonry is not altered by the dyeing process. The only evident effect is the designed colour change.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="guarantee__list-heading">Non-flammable:</h3>
        <span class="guarantee__list-text"> As a result, the dyes are ideal for use in fire surrounds and other areas that are subjected to high temperatures.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
