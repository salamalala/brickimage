  quote: Ashe Park has undergone a substantial renovation, including the construction of a new Georgian front facade. Whilst most of the second hand bricks used for the facade were a good match, some of them stood out like sore thumbs. We asked Brick Image Ltd to come along and match them in. The result (undertaken in less than a day) was spectacular. We could not have asked for a better outcome. The new facade now sits alongside it's older two wings very comfortably, in fact so well that it is often taken for the original.

  quote: Brick Image’s repairs to the existing brickwork on a Grade 2 listed building on Clapham Common were of a high standard, and their ability to match and regularise the appearance of both the brickwork and mortar has, in our opinion, made a considerable improvement to the appearance of the building. The team working on this project possess both a knowledge and empathy for the restoration and conservation of traditional brickwork.

  quote: We unhesitatingly recommend the work of Brick Image. They transformed a large expanse of non matching brickwork so that it now blends perfectly with the original building. Peter has an artist‘s eye for detail and a perfectionist‘s dedication to quality. He works with enormous care and consideration and it shows in the end result. This level of service & skill is very hard to find these days and deserves recognition.

  quote: The work undertaken by Brick Image transformed what was a rather dusty looking, tired old concrete wall into a unified feature that always gains interest from anyone who sees it. The tinting is seamless and complimentary to the original colours of the concrete. Enhancing the details of surface texture and existing wood patterns that I was keen to keep. I couldn't be happier with the result. The work was relatively quick and inexpensive, entirely professional and much more than satisfactory in every way. I have since had 3 valuations on my property for sale and each estate agent has independently remarked on the added value the 'feature wall' has given my apartment.

  quote: Please see attached photo, we are nearly finished now and the photo shows just how well the tinting has worked. The conservatory bricks are a perfect compliment to the house, they look like they were all laid at the same time. Thank you for the time and effort you took to achieve these results. I know our clients are very pleased with the results, as are we. We would have no hesitation whatsoever in using your services in the future or recommending you to anyone who may require this area of expertise. Once again, thanks.

  quote: We were very impressed by Brick Image’s creativity, craftsmanship and pro-active approach. Finding new bricks to match old is always an inexact business but using their expertise we were able to produce a seamless transition. They produced tints and mortar recipes to exactly match the existing masonry. Would have no hesitation in recommending them.
