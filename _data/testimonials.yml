  quote: Ashe Park has undergone a substantial renovation, including the construction of a new Georgian front facade. Whilst most of the second hand bricks used for the facade were a good match, some of them stood out like sore thumbs. We asked Brick Image Ltd to come along and match them in. The result (undertaken in less than a day) was spectacular. We could not have asked for a better outcome. The new facade now sits alongside it's older two wings very comfortably, in fact so well that it is often taken for the original.

  quote: Brick Imageâ€™s repairs to the existing brickwork on a Grade 2 listed building on Clapham Common were of a high standard, and their ability to match and regularise the appearance of both the brickwork and mortar has, in our opinion, made a considerable improvement to the appearance of the building. The team working on this project possess both a knowledge and empathy for the restoration and conservation of traditional brickwork.
