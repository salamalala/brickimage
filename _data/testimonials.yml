  quote: Ashe Park has undergone a substantial renovation, including the construction of a new Georgian front facade. Whilst most of the bricks used were a good match, some stood out like sore thumbs. We asked Brick Image Ltd to come along and match them in. The result (undertaken in less than a day) was spectacular. We could not have asked for a better outcome. The new facade now sits alongside it's older two wings very comfortably, in fact so well that it is often taken for the original.

  quote: Brick Image’s repairs to the existing brickwork on a Grade 2 listed building on Clapham Common were of a high standard, and their ability to match and regularise the appearance of both the brickwork and mortar has, in our opinion, made a considerable improvement to the appearance of the building. The team working on this project possess both a knowledge and empathy for the restoration and conservation of traditional brickwork.

  quote: Brick Image transformed a rather dusty looking, tired old concrete wall into a unified feature that always gains interest from anyone who sees it. The tinting is seamless and complimentary to the original colours of the concrete. Enhancing the details of surface texture and existing wood patterns that I was keen to keep. I couldn't be happier with the result.
