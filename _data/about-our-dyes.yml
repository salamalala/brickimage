  text: "The dyes are composed of microscopic inorganic iron oxide pigments (conforming to British European Standard BS EN 12878:2005). They contain no harmful products and no v.o.c.’s (Volatile Organic Compounds)."

- header: "Ultra fine:"
  text: "The small size of the pigments enables them to effectively penetrate and ‘stain’, rather than ‘coat’, the surface of the masonry."

- header: "Highly durable:"
  text: "The dyes react chemically with the masonry substrate to produce an insoluble, microcrystalline silicate bond. Unlike masonry paints, once applied there are no subsequent maintenance commitments."

- header: "Non-corrosive:"
  text: "The original surface texture of the masonry is not altered by the dyeing process. The only evident effect is the designed colour change."

- header: "Non-flammable:"
  text: "As a result, the dyes are ideal for use in fire surrounds and other areas that are subjected to high temperatures."
