    <h1 class="">What you need to know about conservation</h1>

    <h2 class="">Several factors need consideration before deciding to employ colour adjustments on historic facades.  Understanding the building, its particular issues and historical context, is first and foremost. Furthermore, guidance and approval from local or national conservation bodies will need to be sought in many instances.</h2>
    <p>Many buildings of considerable age and historical importance will display a rich patina that reflects their history and in such instances it may be more appropriate to allow the repairs to be noticeable rather than fully disguise them into their surroundings. When carried out properly, such repairs rarely require any form of colour adjustment at all. Some can argue that a certain degree of integrity can be taken from the knowledge that repairs or extensions have not resorted to any aesthetic ‘correction’.
    However at other times, colour adjustments of newer materials can offer a non-invasive solution for dealing with repairs on facades that demand a relatively high degree of perfection. Tinting allows for ‘toning down’ of newer materials so as to avert the temptation to over clean and damage the existing historic masonry. Quite often, sensitive cleaning followed by isolated toning of newer bricks may offer a better solution. Carefully designed soot washes can be applied in such circumstances and in many situations this is a valid option, but it is worth remembering that washing with soot does not provide the same permanence of effect as decades of atmospheric carbonation. On exposed areas, soot washes can quickly fade, or worse still, can run to create an unpredictable, sometimes messy appearance. It is possible, however, to combine the two by ‘fixing’ traditional soot based pigments to the appropriate level.
    In principle, new brickwork should be matched to the old and not vice versa. An exception to this rule may arise when the removal of coatings, such as paint, creates an irregular appearance next to aged brickwork.
    Understanding the available options and thoroughly scrutinising the brickwork before deciding an appropriate course of action will always pay dividends. It is generally best to consider the use of colour adjustments holistically, together with other planned works including cleaning, repairs and re‐pointing. Localised issues can often be addressed with minimal disruption by thoughtfully combining these activities in moderate proportions rather than relying on blanket treatments to cure all ills. More extensive use of colour however should be given careful thought, especially when seeking to re‐instate previous applications on historic fabric.  In such instances understanding the original materials and their relative proportions is first and foremost following which test panels should inform the decision making process throughout.
    A more thorough discussion on history of colour adjustments and their use within the conservation industry today can be found in a paper entitled ‘Enhancing the Colour of English Brickwork’ written by Peter Sloane, director of Brick Image Ltd, and published in the Journal of Architectural Conservation.
