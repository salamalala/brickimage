    <h1>New Build</h1>

    <p class="article__intro">The increasing demand for new homes in the last few years has created a huge demand for new bricks. At the same time, an increase in the diversity of colours and patterns on offer means that problems can sometimes occur during the production or build process. </p>

    <p> Quite often such problems are not noticed until a scaffold is removed and the bulding is viewed as a whole. When this happens, Tinting may be the best, least invasive way to corrrect aesthetic irrregularities.</p>

    <p>As well as helping home owner solves issues with their new home, we also work with manufacturers or building companies faced with these problems during the build process. That said, in instance where the colour differences are deeper than the surface, we believe that end client (home owner) has a right to know that this work has taken place so that they refrain from undertaking any aggressive cleaning works that might affect the result and guarantee.</p>
